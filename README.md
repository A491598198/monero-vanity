# monero-vanity - WORK IN PROGRESS
monero-vanity is a CLI tool that generates vanity addresses (and spend keys) for Monero, like this one:

|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| [vanity-monero](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/vanity-monero)  | CPU (x86, 32/64-bit)   | Yes   | Yes             | 400k/sec        | 170k/sec
| **[monero-vanity](https://github.com/hinto-janaiyo/monero-vanity)** | CPU (x86, 64-bit)      | Yes   | No              | 5.5million/sec  | 5.5million/sec
| [vanity-xmr-cuda](https://github.com/SChernykh/vanity_xmr_cuda)     | NVIDIA GPU (with CUDA) | No    | No              | 8.1million/sec  |

*Tested with: Ryzen 5950x, GTX 1660 Ti*

## Usage
```
./monero-vanity
```
**Then enter:**
1. Amount of CPUs (threads) to use
2. RNG safety level (Normal/Safe)
3. Which mode to use (Third/First/Full)
4. Which address pattern to look for

After finding the private spend key:
```
./monero-wallet-cli --generate-from-spend-key YOUR_WALLET_NAME
```
Enter the private key and the generated wallet will have the address found.

**Note:**
- `I`, `O`, `l`, `0`, `+`, `/` are invalid characters in [Monero addresses](https://monerodocs.org/cryptography/base58/)
- All characters must be ASCII or a regex pattern

**Safety:**
 - Normal: Private key is generated by reducing a 256-bit integer
 - Safe (slower): Private key is generated by reducing a 512-bit integer

**Modes:**
- Third: matches 3rd-43rd character
- First: matches 1st-43rd character
- Full (SLOWER): matches 1st-95th character
- [Rust regex is allowed in any mode](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex)

**Example:**
- Third: `48hinto...` would match if `hinto` or `h.(N|n).o` was typed
- First: `48hinto.../44h1nto...` would match if `^4(4|8)h(i|1)nto.*$` was typed
- Full: `4...hinto` would match if `^.*hinto$` was typed

## Build
Normal:
```
cargo build --release
```
Optimized (1%~5% speed increase):
```
cargo build --profile optimized
```
Optimized for your specific CPU (15%~ speed increase, depending on your CPU):
```
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo build --profile optimized
```

Add `--target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` to build for Windows.

## Thanks
Big thanks to [kayabaNerve](https://github.com/kayabaNerve) for helping me with ECC cryptography and Rust (he's the reason why it's fast).
